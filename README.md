## Notes
* Use pavucontrol to adjust input/output devices; a recent system update (early 2016)
  is occasionally causing these to be muted even when the hardware switch indicates their not,
  and the best solution I've found is to check pavucontrol and uncheck the invariably
  checked muted button in that interface.
